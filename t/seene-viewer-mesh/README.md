Seene Viewer
============

Simple viewer for Seene captured shots. I just wanted to explore their format
and see what the mesh looks like.

[Seene](http://seene.co/) is an app that captures pictures in 3D. I'm in no
way associated with them, I don't even own the app. Heck, I don't even own a
phone that this app works on.
